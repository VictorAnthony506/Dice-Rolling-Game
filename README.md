# Dice-Rolling-Game

## Version 1 [Dice Rolling Game V1.py]

This version allows 2/3 players to input their player names and this is the only action required of the players.
The program then randomly outputs each players scores as in a 6 faced dice.
When there are two top players the program continues with another round of the game considering only the top players.
The program stops when there is a winner (player with the highest score).

## Version 2 [Dice Rolling Game V2.py]

This version allows two or more players.
The players input their names as a tuple to the game function and as with version 1 there is no further action required.
The program then randomly outputs each players scores as in a 6 faced dice.
When there are top players the program continues with another round of the game considering only the top players.
The program stops when there is a winner (player with the highest score).
